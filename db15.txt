CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    date DATE
);

INSERT INTO sales (id, product, quantity, price, date) VALUES
    (1, 'Product A', 10, 20.00, '2024-05-01'),
    (2, 'Product B', 5, 15.50, '2024-05-02'),
    (3, 'Product A', 8, 22.00, '2024-05-03'),
    (4, 'Product C', 15, 10.00, '2024-05-04'),
    (5, 'Product B', 12, 18.75, '2024-05-05');





1. **Arithmetic Operations and Built-in Functions:**
   - Calculate the total revenue:
   ```sql

   SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
   FROM sales;
  

   - Calculate the average price:
   ```sql

   SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price
   FROM sales;
  

   - Calculate the total quantity of all products:
   ```sql

   SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
   FROM sales;
  

   - Find the minimum and maximum prices:
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price
   FROM sales;
   

2. **Group Functions:**
   - Calculate the total revenue for each product:
   ```sql

   SELECT product, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY product;
  

   - Find the product with the highest total revenue:
   ```sql

   SELECT product, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY product
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 1;
 

   - Find the total revenue for each month:
   ```sql

   SELECT MONTH(date) AS month, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY MONTH(date);
